# Introduction {#introduction}
Welcome to the Nekosia API documentation! Here you will find detailed information about the API interface, including descriptions of available endpoints, request methods, and response formats.

The Nekosia API follows a `RESTful` architecture, meaning all operations are performed according to REST principles. Requests and responses are transmitted in JSON format, making data integration and processing easier.

The documentation also includes code examples and use cases to help you get started quickly. Whether you're a developer creating a new application or an integrator looking for an efficient solution, you'll find all the necessary information here.

## Important to Understand {#important}
- **Variety of Content:**  
  The Nekosia API provides access to not only neko images but also other categories, offering a wide range of available content.

- **Own Booru:**  
  Nekosia offers its own booru, allowing users to browse and add images (feature coming soon).

- **Integration with Booru:**  
  The booru is integrated with the API. Users can submit requests to the booru, such as tagging changes or content improvements. After verification by moderators, updated data will be available in the API responses.

- **Avoiding Duplicates in Responses:**  
  The API includes session mechanisms (identified by IP address or random identification key) to avoid duplicate responses. This way, users can receive different images depending on the specific session.

- **No API Key Required:**  
  The API does not require authorization keys or tokens, so you don't need to register to use it. This increases accessibility and convenience.

- **Image Hosting:**  
  All images are hosted on the Nekosia server, and their availability is ensured by the API, guaranteeing constant access to resources.

- **Safe Content:**  
  No image is NSFW (Not Safe For Work), meaning all images are appropriate for all age groups.

- **Uptime:**  
  The API and website are monitored by an external system 24/7, ensuring availability at all times. Users can use the services at any time without interruptions. In case of planned maintenance, users will be informed in advance.

- **User Collaboration:**  
  Any comments, suggestions, or issues related to the API can be reported on the Discord server or via email. We are open to feedback and eager to collaborate with users to further improve our services.

- **Free Usage:**  
  The API is free to use, meaning there are no charges or usage restrictions.

> These are just a few key points to understand before starting to use the API. More information on the available features can be found on the [official website](/).
> We encourage you to read the full documentation to fully utilize the capabilities offered by the API. Good luck!

## Semantic Versioning {#semver}
The Nekosia API uses semantic versioning 2.0.0. Each version consists of three numbers `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`. The versioning rules are as follows:
- `MAJOR (x)` - increased when introducing changes that are not backward compatible. Examples include removing or modifying existing features in a way that requires users to adjust their code.
- `MINOR (y)` - increased when adding new features that are backward compatible. Examples include adding new endpoints or configuration options that do not affect existing functionalities.
- `PATCH (z)` - increased when making fixes, bug corrections, and security improvements. Such changes are usually minor and do not affect backward compatibility.

### Versioning Examples {#semver-examples}
- Version `1.0.0` indicates the first official release of the API.
- Version `1.1.0` indicates that new features compatible with version `1.0.0` have been added. An example might be the addition of a new data retrieval endpoint.
- Version `1.1.1` indicates that bug fixes or security improvements have been made to version `1.1.0`. For example, fixing a user authorization bug.
- Version `2.0.0` indicates that changes not compatible with version `1.1.1` have been introduced. An example might be removing or changing existing features that require users to adjust their code.

### Available API Versions {#api-versions}
The currently available API version is `v1`, which is the only version. Future versions containing new features and improvements are planned.
In case of changes, the documentation will be updated to reflect the latest changes. Users will also be notified on the Discord server and the website.
