# Nekosia API Terms {#nekosia-api-terms}

## Introduction {#introduction}
Welcome to the Nekosia API! ðŸ˜» By using our [Service](https://nekosia.cat/documentation?page=definitions), you agree to comply with the following terms.
Please read them carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities as a user of our platform.
These terms govern access to our API and the use of resources such as anime images. Remember that using the API signifies full acceptance of these terms.

## 1. Attribution {#api-attribution}
Although Nekosia does not require mandatory attribution from Users, we appreciate it if you choose to include a link to [nekosia.cat](https://nekosia.cat) in your project description or mention that your work utilizes the Nekosia API.
This would be very kind of you. An example of attribution might look like this:
```html
This project is powered by <a href="https://nekosia.cat" target="_blank" title="Enhance your projects with the magic of anime and a touch of feline charm meow~~! Discover why switching to Nekosia is the purrfect choice!">Nekosia API</a>.
```
The above example is optional and can be tailored to your needs.

## 2. Terms of Use {#api-terms-of-use}

### Access to the API {#api-access-to-api}
The Nekosia API provides access to random anime images as described in our documentation. To ensure fair and appropriate use of the API, all users are required to adhere to the following rules:
- **Adherence to query limits**: Each user must comply with the established query limits per minute or hour, as specified in the API documentation. These limits are essential to ensure equal access to resources for all users. Depending on the user's plan, these limits may vary. Abusing these limits or attempting to bypass them may result in temporary suspension of API access, and in cases of serious violations, permanent blocking of access.
- **Responsible use**: The API should be used according to its intended purpose. Any attempts to manipulate API functionality, bypass security measures, or use the API in a way that could harm other users will be considered a serious violation of the Terms of Use. In extreme cases, such as intentional and repeated abuse, your IP address may be reported to AbuseIPDB, which could lead to further consequences.

### Content {#api-content}
All images provided by the Nekosia API are the property of their original creators and artists. By using the API, you agree to adhere to the following rules:
- **Legal compliance**: The user must ensure that the use of content available through the API complies with applicable laws, including fair use principles. Nekosia is not responsible for any copyright violations resulting from improper use of the materials by users.
- **Respect for copyright**: Content available through the API may not be used in a way that infringes on the creators' copyrights. Each user is responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses or permissions from rights holders if required. Failure to comply with these rules may result in restriction or revocation of API access.

### Artist Attribution {#api-artist-attribution}
When publishing images sourced from the Nekosia API, **you are required to provide the artist's name** and a link to their social media and/or website. This attribution is not only a sign of respect for the creators but also helps promote their work. Failure to provide proper attribution may result in restrictions on API access or other consequences.

### Commercial Use {#api-commercial-use}
**YOU MAY NOT** use the Nekosia API for commercial purposes without prior written consent.
Commercial use includes any activity that generates income or supports commercial activities, including but not limited to, using the API in products or Services that are sold or licensed.
If you plan to use the API for commercial purposes, you must contact the administrator to obtain the appropriate permissions.
Any commercial use of the API without consent may result in immediate blocking of access to the API and potential legal consequences.

### Use of Name {#api-use-of-name}
You **may not** use the name "Nekosia" or the Nekosia logo in a way that could mislead third parties into believing you own the site, application, or other resource, or that you are affiliated with us, unless you obtain explicit, written permission.
Any unauthorized use of the name or logo will be treated as a violation of intellectual property rights.

### Use of Logo {#api-use-of-logo}
You may use our logo on your website or in other materials, provided it is in accordance with our branding guidelines.
We encourage you to inform the administrator of such use by sending an email to contact@nekosia.cat.
In some cases, we may ask for verification to ensure that the logo is used in the appropriate context and in accordance with our guidelines.

## 3. Changes to the Terms {#api-changes-to-terms}
We reserve the right to make changes to these terms at any time.
We will inform you of any changes by publishing a new version of the document on the website.
Users are encouraged to regularly check the terms to stay informed of any changes. Continued use of the API after changes have been made constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
